WSGI Flavor Guide
=================

Using the WSGI flavor, you can deploy any python web application following the
`WSGI standard`_. This includes frameworks like Flask, web.py and others.  We 
offer special support for Django applications.

Let's create a very simple WSGI app. The app is available on our 
`example repository`_ on Github.

The structure of the repository looks like this::

    +--> wsgiapp
         +--> __init__.py
         +--> main.py

The code is a very basic example of a WSGI app. Edit ``wsgiapp/main.py`` and 
insert the following code.

.. code-block:: py

    def application(environ, start_response):
        status = '200 OK'
        response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')]
        start_response(status, response_headers)
        return ['Hello world!\n']

This function serves as an entrypoint for the app server. Each incoming 
request will be routed to this function. WSGI entrypoints have to be specified 
in the following format: ``python.module.path:callable``. In this example this 
is ``wsgiapp.main:application``.

So let's create the application and deploy it. First create the new app and 
create an environment:

::

    $ thirty create app wsgiapp

    {
        "environments": [],
        "name": "wsgiapp",
        "repository": {
            "location": "git://github.com/crito/wsgiapp.git",
            "name": "wsgiapp",
            "variant": "git"
        },
        "variant": "python"
    }

    $ thirty create app wsgiapp dev

    {
        "backends": [{"region": "eu1", "count": 1}],
        "cname_records": [],
        "flavor": "wsgi", 
        "install_setup_py": false, 
        "name": "dev", 
        "repo_branch": "master", 
        "repo_commit": "HEAD",
        "requirements_file": "",            
        "wsgiflavor": {
            "wsgi_entrypoint": "wsgiapp.main:application",
            "wsgi_project_root": "wsgiapp"
        }
    }   

Now we deploy the application environment::

    $ thirty deploy wsgiapp dev

    Started deployment (logbook uuid: 8b932504-5e12-11e1-9efc-1a09507dbcf2)
