Quickstart guide
================

This guide will provide some basic information about the platform and walk you
through the following steps:

#) Installing the 30loops client
#) Creating an application
#) Deploying an application

We will configure and deploy an example app you can find in our `sample apps on 
github`_. Its a very simple CherryPy application.

Installing the 30loops client
=============================

.. note::

    The quickstart guide assumes that you use the ``thirty`` client command for
    all operations. Of course, you can also create the necessary JSON messages
    by hand or have them generated by some tool.

    See :ref:`curl-examples-label` for an alternative way to use the 30loops
    platform.

Installing the ``thirty`` client is very simple:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install thirty-cli

For detailed instructions how to install the client see
:ref:`client-installation` for more information.

We configure your account by running the setup wizard of the client. You can
find :ref:`here <thirty-client-configuration-file>` more information.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ thirty setup

.. _`sample apps on github`: https://30loops.github.com

Creating an app
===============

Create an app with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ thirty create <app> <repository_location>

Replace ``<app>`` with the name of your application. Replace
``repository_location`` with the URL to your code repository. At the moment
only Git repositories are supported. Every command has its own help function:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ thirty help create <app>

This will show help for the ``create app`` action. In this quickstart we
will deploy a simple cherrypy application. So our command looks like:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ thirty create cherryonloops git://github.com/30loops/cherrypy-on-30loops.git

This will create an app configuration named ``cherryonloops`` and a repository
configuration named ``cherryonloops``.

To see the configuration of the newly created app, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ thirty show cherryonloops

It will output something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    name: cherryonloops
    variant: python
    region: ams1
    instances: 1
    repo_commit: HEAD
    dns_record: 30loops-app-cherryonloops.30loops.net
    repository
        name: cherryonloops
        variant: git
        location: git://github.com/30loops/cherrypy-on-30loops.git
    database
        name: 30loops-db-cherryonloops
        variant: postgres
        username: 30loops-db-cherryonloops
        host: not deployed
        password: OTYzMzgzZmNi
        port: not deployed

The app is now defined. We will continue with deploying the newly created app.

Deploying an app
================

.. note::

    The actual environment settings of your app is stored inside your
    repository, in a file called ``thirty.ini``. See
    :ref:`runtime-configuration-label` for more information.

Deploying an app is quite simple and fast, just run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ thirty deploy cherryonloops

This will start the deployment. Every action you run on your resources creates
a logbook. The command client starts polling the logbook immediately. You can
also access the logbook manually by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ thirty logbook UUID

Where UUID is the ID of the deployment task.

After a succesfull deploy, your application will be availabl on the specified
DNS record: ``http://30loops-app-cherrypyon30loops.30loops.net``.

Where to go
===========

To continue, you should read the indepth :doc:`30loops platform manual
<manual>`.  We created a few sample applications. You can find examples for a
lot of different applications and stacks on https://30loops.github.com/

All your apps are created as free tier apps and have certain restrictions. If
you want to go live with your app read the section on :ref:`the free tier
<tier-label>`.
